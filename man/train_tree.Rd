\title{Fit a Decision Tree Model}
\usage{
train_tree(
  data_train = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  target_lab = NULL,
  model = c("rpart", "party", "C50", "caret"),
  task = c("classification", "regression"),
  control = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_train}{Data frame. Explicit training set. If NULL, will be subset from \code{data} by \code{data_type == 'train'}.}

\item{data}{Data frame. Combined dataset with a \code{data_type} column when \code{data_train} is NULL.}

\item{target_lab}{Character. Name of the target column to predict.}

\item{model}{Character. Which implementation to use: one of "rpart", "party", "C50", or "caret".}

\item{task}{Character. Type of task: "classification" or "regression".}

\item{control}{List or control object. Optional control parameters passed to the chosen tree function.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\item{fit}{A party object representing the fitted tree.}
\item{var_imp}{A named numeric vector of relative variable importance (scaled to sum to 1 and rounded to two decimals).}
}
\description{
Fits a decision tree to training data using one of several supported tree implementations
(rpart, party, C50, or via caret) and returns a standardized party object along with
variable importance scores.
